# Todos

- create a chache file
- Make a log file _for debugging_
- ## Perfect and Partial Match Changes

  - Should show at least one match for all excel names
  -  ``perfect match`` should have unique pairs
  - If name is already ``perfect matched`` then don't show in partial match > user will naturally delete name

# Bugs

- UI
- Show if the partial match is already in perfect match
- Flask or React
